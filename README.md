# Tridender-Skirts
A skirt-mod for the Ender 3 in a Voron Trident style.
Hey Hey!

My Trident Skirt adaption finally made it to Printables! Wanna have the Trident Skirts on your Ender 3? You're welcome ;)


### What is this about?

Well, basically this adds the awesome Trident Skirts to the Ender 3 - the real Trident skirts. Other models I've seen so far scaled the original skirts up or down in order to make it compatible with the Ender 3 - this changes the size of the Hexagons, which changes the look and don't allow to use Addons that has been made for the Trident Skirts.

### Why are there so many folders?

There are two versions of the Skirts - The “Only Front”  and the “360 Skirts”. While the Only Front only adds the Skirt to the front the 360 gets mounted all the way around the Ender, which gives it a very beefy look, I really like it.
Than there are also folders which contains files to create the awesome looking mesh skirts (for both versions) which fill the gaps up with a nice infill pattern!

### Note!

Only the Only Front Skirts are compatible with the stock electronic enclosure and the display! The 360 skirts add a mini12864 display and you need a new solution to mount your electronics. I used a Din rail for that.

### What's the difference between the normal and “_mesh” files?

I will add a tutorial how to print the mesh files as soon as possible!

You need the normal and the mesh files to create the nice looking Mesh Skirts. These will be loaded into the slicer and the settings for the _mesh body gets set to infill only (no top and bottom layers). When you load the files into the slicer you will see that they aren't orientated. I cant do that as for the other files because when I save them in the correct orientation they loose they're shared origin (which is needed to get them loaded as 1 body made out of 2 pieces). So please Flip them by your own.
